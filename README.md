## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
An eigenface is the name given to a set of eigenvectors when used in the computer vision problem of human face recognition. The approach of using eigenfaces for recognition was developed by Sirovich and Kirby and used by Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland in face classification. The eigenvectors are derived from the covariance matrix of the probability distribution over the high-dimensional vector space of face images.

In this repo, I reimplement the first face recognition algorithm from scratch to better understand the core concept behind eigenvectors and eigenfaces. I tried to keep the code well-organised and clean to make it helpful for others interested in the implementation
of this paper.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
In order to locally run the repo you should have the following:
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html)


### Installing
If you want to run the code on your local machine, you need to follow the next steps.

 1. First you need to create a conda environment with the following command:

```bash
conda create --name eigenfaces --file requirements.txt python=3.10
```

  2. Secondly, you need to activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate eigenfaces
```
  3. Open in the editor of your choice the notebook eigenfaces from the folder src/notebooks
